# DatabaseProject
Here are some ideas for a database:

1 - Custom job board database

This database would have entities/tables of different job boards.
Example: Indeed, Wellfound, LinkedIn, BitcoinerJobs, Cryptojobs, Handshake, Glassdoor, MTHTBA.
Attributes would be categories.
Example: JobType(part-time,full-time,internship), Location(remote,city), PositionType(Financial,Software,Customer Service), DatePosted, SalaryRange, ExperienceLevel.
Use-cases: 
Have an all-encompassing board to find specific jobs you are interested in.
Easily query and toggle based on the desired job. E.g part-time finance job from this job board.
Make job-search easier if real-time data is integrated and apply to job faster.

2 - Coffee guidebook database

This database would have entities/tables of different coffee shops.
Example: Clyde, Drum, Blackcoffee, Bernice, etc.
Attributes would be attractions.
Example: Location, Rating, BestMenuItem, PriceLevel, etc.
Use-cases: 
Easily find the coffeeshop to go to depending on what your want at the moment.
Compare coffee shops by rating, price, etc.
This could also be enhanced with real-time data updated.

3 - Cost of Living/Salary database

This database would have databases of different places you can live and jobs.
Example: USA, Africa, Canada, Brazil, Montana, NewYork, California, Italy.
Attributes would be factors that impact cost of living.
Example: CPI, AverageWage, Inflation, JobOpenings, etc.
Use-cases:
Inform decision on where you live.
See interesting statists on the economy around the world.
Also enhanced with real-time data and could be a go to calculator to find cost of living with all factors included.
